( CRITICAL )

INDEX PAGE

# CLUSTER & SINGLE MAP - when selecting campsite or using manual map controls, keep the map active (keep the activate-overlay hidden)

# MAPS - fix scroll when hovering over popover

# SHOW PAGE MAP - activate overlay when clicking outside of the map to the left or right

# fix the flash message dismiss button

### fix the routing issue after logging in where you sometimes end up at an error page or you don't end up back on the page your were on previously

( IMPORTANT )

EDIT PAGE

# style the 'delete-images' container so it doesn't overlap the footer

# sort out the price container input ouline

LOGIN/REGISTER PAGE/S

# add some styling to both pages.
# possibly combine into one page???

# add pagination to index page
# add pagination than doesn't refresh the whole page
- get req.queries working for pagination

( nice to haves )

# add a favicon

HOME PAGE

# add background image

# dark overlay

OTHERS

# style the boilerplate header and footer a bit nicer. i.e. change colours and button styling

# fixed some inline script errors by putting the functions in the script.js files

# in "edit" & "new" pages, form inputs will resize when window is resized

# added a hover effect on the flash messages

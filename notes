( CRITICAL )

- fix the routing issue after logging in where you sometimes end up at an error page or you don't end up back on the page your were on previously

( IMPORTANT )

- show uploaded images when selected for upload (in "new" and "edit" pages)
- needs more control over what page (pagination) you are on. up and down 1 page at a time ONLY is not a good experience.

( nice to haves )


- MAPS - fix scroll when hovering over popover
- fix the "back" button on the "show" page to actually go back to "all campgrounds"
